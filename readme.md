# FastAPI CRUD Application

This project is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, with SQLite as the database. The application provides RESTful API endpoints to manage items in a database and demonstrates fundamental CRUD operations.

## Features

- Create an item
- Read (retrieve) an item or list of items
- Update an existing item
- Delete an item
- Basic data validation and response models using Pydantic

## Technologies Used

- **FastAPI** - Web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python-type hints
- **SQLAlchemy** - ORM (Object Relational Mapper) to handle database operations
- **SQLite** - Lightweight database for storing data
- **Pydantic** - Data validation library used by FastAPI for defining request and response models

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+** should be installed on your system. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gautamraj8044/FastAPI-CRUD-API.git
   cd FastAPI-CRUD-API
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run database migrations (if needed).

## Project Structure

```markdown
- main.py               # Main application file with FastAPI instance and endpoints
- models.py             # Database models defined using SQLAlchemy
- schemas.py            # Pydantic schemas for request and response validation
- database.py           # Database setup and configuration
- README.md             # Project README file
```

## Usage

1. Run the application:

## Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint      | Description           |
|--------|---------------|-----------------------|
| POST   | `/items/`     | Create a new item     |
| GET    | `/items/`     | Retrieve all items    |
| GET    | `/items/{id}` | Retrieve an item by ID|
| PUT    | `/items/{id}` | Update an item by ID  |
| DELETE | `/items/{id}` | Delete an item by ID  |

## Example Item Schema

### Request (ItemCreate)

```json
{
  "name": "Sample Item",
  "description": "This is a sample item."
}
```

### Response (ItemResponse)

  "name": "Sample Item",
  "description": "This is a sample item."
}
```
